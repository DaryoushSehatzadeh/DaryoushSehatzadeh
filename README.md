# 🏋️‍♂️ Hi, my name is Daryoush but everyone calls me Darius

**`IT Programming Student & Aspiring Developer`**

I'm an IT Programming student at NSCC. I have a strong foundation in several coding languages and frameworks, project management, and systems analysis. I get fired up by solving complex problems and continuously improving my skills. My goal is a career in full-stack development or systems architecture, where I can create scalable, efficient solutions.

Outside of school and coding I'm a weightlifter and music producer.
